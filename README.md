# üöÄ Peristaltic Pump Controller (Mycodo compatible)
![Header image](/assets/header.jpg)

## üìë Overview
Simplistic peristaltic pump controller firmware to control 4 pumps via serial commands.

In addition, a stirring output is available, which automatically switches on/off to pre-stir the liquids before the pumps activate.

For use with [Mycodo](https://kizniche.github.io/Mycodo/) a custom output is available in `mycodo` folder.
### üîß Hardware

### üß™ 1. Dose Amount (`1 stepperNumber amount`)
- **Description**: Dispense a specified amount of liquid using a designated stepper motor. 
- üö®Can only be used after calibration (see 2)
- **Parameters**:
    - `stepperNumber` (integer): The ID of the stepper motor (1 to 4).
    - `amount` (float): The amount of liquid to be dispensed in milliliters.
- **Example**:
  ```plaintext
  1 2 15.5
  ```
  This command will instruct stepper motor 2 to dispense 15.5 milliliters of liquid.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Set Calibration Mode (`2 stepperNumber status amountMl`)
- **Description**: Choose a stepper motor, enter calibration mode to measure and calibrate the steps per milliliter.
- **How to use**:
    * ‚ö†Ô∏è Calibration procedure: the result is used for all four steppers/pumps. You don't need to do it separately for each of the steppers/pumps
    * Get a measuring cup to dispense the liquid in during measurement
    * Start calibration mode and set the amount of liquid you want to use for calibration (e.g. 500ml)
    * The pump will immediately start to dispense
    * Watch the measuring cup
    * Stop the calibration mode as soon as the selected amount was dispensed
    * Calibration is done
- **Parameters**:
    - `stepperNumber` (integer): The ID of the stepper motor (1 to 4).
    - `status` (boolean): `1` to start calibration mode, `0` to stop it.
    - `amountMl` (integer, optional): The amount of liquid in milliliters for calibration. Defaults to 300 ml if not specified.
- **Example**:
  ```plaintext
  2 3 1 250
  ```
  This command will set stepper motor 3 to calibration mode to measure 250 milliliters of liquid. To finish calibration, send:
  ```plaintext
  2 3 0
  ```

### üì° 3. Ping (`3`)
- **Description**: Respond with a simple message to confirm the connection.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Example**:
  ```plaintext
  3
  ```
  This command will trigger a response message "{"device":"PumpsX4", "version":"1.0"}".

### üÜë 4. Reset All (`4`)
- **Description**: Immediately stop all motors.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Example**:
  ```plaintext
  4
  ```
  This command will reset all stepper motors and stop their movements.

#### Example Usage

To dose 10 milliliters via stepper motor 1:
```plaintext
1 1 10.0
```

To start calibration mode on stepper motor 2 for 300 milliliters:
```plaintext
2 2 1 300
```

To stop calibration mode on stepper motor 2:
```plaintext
2 2 0
```

To ping the device:
```plaintext
3
```

To stop all pumps:
```plaintext
4
```
