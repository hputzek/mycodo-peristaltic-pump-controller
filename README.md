# üöÄ Peristaltic Pump Controller (Mycodo compatible)
![Header image](/assets/header.jpg)

## üìë Overview
Simplistic peristaltic pump controller firmware to control 6 pumps (4 stepper-based and 2 regular DC motor-based) via serial commands.

In addition, a stirring output is available, which automatically switches on/off to pre-stir the liquids before the pumps activate.

For use with [Mycodo](https://kizniche.github.io/Mycodo/) a custom output is available in `mycodo` folder.
### üîß Hardware
[For how to prepare the hardware refer to the hardware docs](./docs/setup-hardware.md)

## üìù How to Use
For use with [Mycodo](https://kizniche.github.io/Mycodo/) refer to 

### [setup in mycodo](./mycodo/README.md)

### For direct control via serial commands:

1. Connect the controller to your computer or any device capable of sending serial commands.
2. Open a serial terminal or use a program to send commands.
3. Use the command format as described below to send instructions to the device.
4. The device will execute the command and provide feedback through the serial connection.
